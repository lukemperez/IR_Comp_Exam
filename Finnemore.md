# 1996. National Interests in International Society

**Thesis** The vast majority of international politics is the
defining, rather than defending, of national interests because norms
*shape* interests. IOs have the power to change state interests
through persuasion and, when possible or necessary, coercion. 

Running counter to the overwhelming majority of contemporary IR,
Finnemore argues that we ought not assume that states hold stable and
relatively fixed interests. So much of the literature assumes either
that interests are "unproblematic" or that they can located entirely
internal to the state. Finnemore addresses the neo-/neo- debate head
on---which was among the major paradigm fissures at the time of her
writing---pointing out that the core of the disagreement about the
content of preferences assigned to states was not zero-sum. Where
realists and liberals saw a dichotomy between, say, economic
vs. military power or absolute vs relative gains, Finnemore's approach
is "paradigm neutral" because it seeks to explain the causal processes
through which a state comes to prioritize one set of preferences over
another.

**Objections** 

Finnemore's work has at least two serious flaws. First is the argument
that IOs are merely a vessel for state power and thus, their power to
influence states is always a function of the power backing it (i.e.,
the collective power of the states which comprise the IO). Second,
whatever the findings, her approach may not be necessary because a
utility maximizing logic of consequence (vs. Finnemore's logic of
appropriateness) may predict the same outcome regardless of the
norms. Rationalist approaches, therefore, may offer more elegant and
logically tight hypotheses of state behavior. Here Finnemore may
respond in one of several ways: Against the first line of criticism,
it is not always clear that IOs do not have their own interests and
agendas in mind (cf. Barnett and Finnemore, Abbot and Snidal,
etc.). The legal autonomy and issue area expertise give IOs an immense
latitude to pursue agendas distinct from their state sponsors. Against
the second objection, is that the constructivist approach may actually
predict something different than rationalist approaches. Namely,
rationalism may predict different behavior insofar as states as
different utility functions but Finnemore argues her approach will
predict similar behavior from different states.

Whatever the limits of her criticism, it's worth noting that later
scholarship has taken up this line of question, focusing on how
interests are formulated (e.g., Wagner 2010; Braumoeller
2012). Braumoeller, for instance, while remaining within the rational
choice approach, situates international politics with a series of
nested arrangements and the gap between a perceived status quo between
any state and the citizens' desire for a change.
