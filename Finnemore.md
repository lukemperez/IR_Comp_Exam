# 1996. National Interests in International Society

**Thesis** The vast majority of international politics is the
defining, rather than defending, of national interests because norms
*shape* interests. 

Running counter to the overwhelming majority of contemporary IR,
Finnemore argues that we ought not assume that states hold stable and
relatively fixed interests. So much of the literature assumes either
that interests are "unproblematic" or that they can located entirely
internal to the state.
