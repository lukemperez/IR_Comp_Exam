# 2011. *The Reductionist Gamble*

Oatley critiques the methodological reductionism of OEP because it
risks producing false or inaccurate knowledge. According to Oatley,
OEP assumes---rather than shows---that the system under study can be
studied without consideration of system level effects. In at least
three issue areas he shows that modeling the system level effects
produces different findings from a strict OEP method that only models
domestic level variables.
