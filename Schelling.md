# 1960. *Strategy of Conflict*

See extended reviews (July 2016). 

# 1966. *Arms and Influence*

Continues and extends many of the insights found in *Strategy of
Conflict*. Schelling seems concerned chiefly with the ability to
deter, and how nations can make their commitments credible to
adversaries. Making credible threats is a function of several factors,
some of which are out of the deterrer's control. For instance, the
U.S. does not need to make threats about its willingness to defend
California, but it must go through great lengths to assert it will
defend allies in Europe and Asia. Would the U.S. really go to war over
Taiwan? Perhaps, perhaps not. But the U.S. spends a lot of time and
energy convincing China that it would or might---enough to create
uncertainty on the part of Chinese strategists. And here lies one of
the central challenges of deterrence: ensuring that one has accurately
communicated one's intent and, more importantly, understood the
other's intent. What Schelling shows, however, is that more than
communicating intent is need to enhancing one's obligation to respond
(p. 50). Over and above effective communication, finding ways to
ensure a response is one of the few ways to truly signal intent.
