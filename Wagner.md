# 1986. The Balance of Power and the Theory of Games

Using noncooperative game theory, Wagner models balancing theory in
systems between 3--5 states. He shows that a core 'realist' (scare
quotes original) assumptions like exogenous change in
preferences---i.e., no state can be sure another's preferences will
not change tomorrow---uncertainty, and the possibility of conflict can
lead to stability within a given system. Stability, however, is
defined as the non-death of states; that is, war and conflict can
occur, but the system is considered stable if all states
remain. Peace, in contrast, is defined as the absence of war. Although
it is possible for there to be stability without peace, Wagner is
silent on the possibility of peace without stability.
