# 1959. *Man, the State, and War*

*Man, the State, and War*, from Waltz's dissertation, examines the
levels of analysis (individual, state, system) and the causes of war
and peace among nations.

# 1979. *Theory of International Politics*

*Theory of Internat'l Politics* lays the foundation for nearly all
contemporary IR research either by critiquing, extending, or modifying
Waltz's basic definitions of theory, reductionist/systemic approaches,
and philosophy of social science. Waltz's microeconomic method and
systemic approach recast classical realism into it's neorealist, or
structural, formulation found in Mearshimer and others. Waltz stresses
the material forces of the international system because he finds the
analysis produced by first-image or second-image approaches
wanting. For instance, following Durkheim, Waltz argues that
organization principles of functional differentiation and distribution
of capabilities shape actors and systems. But because of anarchy,
there is no functional differentiation. Thus, we only need to consider
the distribution of capabilities, or power. The strength of this
argument, is a parsimonious theory; systemic theory building allows
him to derive elegant "theories" about international politics when
states are treated like firms in microeconomic theory. Statistics, for
example, "are simply description in numberical form" (p. 3). What
matters is not the quantitative (or formal) model and evidence, but
the theory building. However influential *Theory of International
Politics* proved to be, his prescriptions were not uniformly
received. Neoclassical-Realism and Open Economy Politics, for example,
marked a turn toward second-image analysis and attempt to look at
variables within states as causes for international political
phenomenon.
