# 1959. *Man, the State, and War*

*Man, the State, and War*, from Waltz's dissertation, examines the
levels of analysis (individual, state, system) and the causes of war
and peace among nations.

# 1979. *Theory of International Politics*

*Theory of Internat'l Politics* lays the foundation for nearly
all contemporary IR research either by critiquing, extending, or
modifying Waltz's basic definitions of theory, reductionist/systemic
approaches, and philosophy of social science. Waltz's microeconomic
method and systemic approach recast classical realism into it's
neorealist, or structural, formulation found in Mearshimer and
others. Waltz stresses the material forces of the international system
because he finds the analysis produced by first-image or second-image
approaches wanting. The goal of any theory is /parsimony/; systemic
theory building allows him to derive elegant "theories" about
international politics when states are treated like firms in
microeconomic theory. Statistics, for example, "are simply description
in numberical form" (p. 3). What matters is not the quantitative (or
formal) model and evidence, but the theory building. However
influential /Theory of International Politics/ proved to be, his
prescriptions were not uniformly received. Neoclassical-Realism and
Open Economy Politics, for example, marked a turn toward second-image
analysis and attempt to look at variables within states as causes for
international political phenomenon.
