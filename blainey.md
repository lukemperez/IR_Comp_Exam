# 1988. *The Causes of War* 

Blainey's /The Causes of War/ surveys every major war from 1700 to
roughly 1970, showing how much of the conventional wisdom about the
causes of war are misguided or outright false. War occurs because of
power imbalances and misperceptions about any given nation's position
in the world. Although Blainey lacks the rigor of formal or empirical
models, his findings approach conclusions found by political
scientists: that war is bargaining problem of sorts, a part of the
political process between nations. One notable line of inquiry is his
study of the Manchester creed of the late-19th and early-20th
century. Cooperation in this period was at least as deep and broad as
modern globalization, then as now, the conventional wisdom was that
economics and cultural openness were making war obsolete. But then, as
now, politics rather than economics proves to be sovereign.
