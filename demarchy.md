# 2005. Computational and Mathematical Modeling in the Social Sciences

Examines the limitations of quantitative and and formal models in
political science, arguing that computational models can compliment
and improve traditional empirical and formal research designs.
Following Achen (2002), de Marchi argues that empirical modeling too
often includes an over abundance of variables, thereby overfitting
their model and producing spurious findings (p. 11). Formal theorists
are not immune to this problem because an abundance of logically
consistent models exist that can be fitted to the empirical
observations such that whatever the researcher wishes to show, /a
priori/ can usually be shown. Computation models, however, can
adjudicate between various models by allowing researchers to test a
model against a closer approximation of the Data Generating Process
(DGP) before doing so on the actual empirical data. This approach,
along with /out-of-sample/ (OOS) testing helps researchers avoid the
pitfalls of overfitting or underfitting their models.
