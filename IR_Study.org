* General Concepts
** Levels of Analysis
1. Individual Level
   1. Human Behavior
      1. Classical IR (Carr, Morgenthau, Neibuhr) focused on "human
         nature" as /the/ cause of war. Rejected as reductionist by
         Waltz and structural theorists.
      2. Structuralism's strength from 1980ff waning in light of
         evolutionary psychology, GT, constructivism
      3. Renewed interest of individual levels and their interaction
         with state and system suggests potential for dynamic models
         of IR (IPE, systems theory, etc.) ::need citation:: 
   2. Human Nature
   3. Criticisms
      1. Arguments of human nature (cf. Morgenthau, Neibuhr) are
         reductionist
      2. Individuals are not the essential actors in IR
2. State Level
   1. Domestic politics pushing upward into the system
   2. Examples included
      1. Open Economy Politics
      2. Neoclassical realism
   
3. System Level
   1. Anarchy is a material variable, creates incentives and
      constraints on state behavior
   2. Criticisms
      1. Waltz relies on theoretical reductionism, treating the state
         as a microeconomic firm. 
** Agent-Structure Problem
1. Who influences who, /agents on structure/ or /structures on agents/?
2. Rationalists emphasize the agents as those who make the system and institutions
   1. Wagner (2010) suggests the international system is the product
      of international bargains between states
   2. Milner (199?) raises the possibility that it could be
      /rationalism all the way down/ such that important concepts,
      like sovereignty, thought to be firm are much more malleable.
3. Constructivists stress the constitutive ontology of agents and structures
   1. Agents and structure emerge together
   2. Structure shapes agents in ways that are largely imperceptible.
      1. Wendt (1999) on the culture's of anarchy: Hobbesian, Lockean, Kantian
      2. Ruggie (1992): Embedded liberalism thesis. Logic of
         free-market, global capitalism baked into the system by the
         framers of post-war order.          
** Principle-Agent Model
** Strategic models
*** Interests vs. Preferences
1. Not identical
   1. Preferences are /what/ individual actors want.
   2. Interests are /why/ they want.
2. Norms, morality, or interest may drive interests (Wagner 2010;
   Frieden 1999 [Lake and Powell])
   1. preferences and the conflict between them are what drive strategy.
   2. NB: Hobbes on the causes of war: competition, diffidence, glory
      /vs/ Thucydides' fear, pride, interest.
3. Interests are /shaped/ by the system. 
   1. Finnemore argues international politics is about defining, not
      defending, national interests (1996).
   2. Constructivism asks why non-like states produce like behavior
      and suggest the answer lies in the conditioning.
   3. Waltz's dictum that states evolve toward like units suggests
      normative processes at play.
** Institutions
*** Rationalists Definitions
1. International regimes
   1. Laws of War
   2. International Organizations
2. Institutions as human made constraints and economic models
   1. "Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure
      political, economic and social interaction. They consist of both
      informal constraints... and formal rules. ... Together with the
      standard constraints of economics they define the choice set and
      therefore determine transaction and production costs and hence
      the profitability and feasibility of engaging in economic
      activity" (North 1991).
3. Actors (states, non-states) behave in predictable patterns and seek
   utility maximizing strategies for any given strategy space (Lake
   and Powell 1999). 


*** Normative Definitions
1. The rules and patterns of behavior Keohane (1987).
2. Cultures of anarchy and norm dynamics
   1. Multiple "cultures" of enmity, competition, friendship that form
      a path dependency between any two (or groups) of nations (Wendt 1999)
   2. Change within and between cultures depends on entrepreneurs who
      bring about change in state behavior, ultimately changing the
      path dependency of relationships between actors (Finnemore and Sikkink).
3. 
** Cooperation 
*** Cooperation /vs/ Anarchy
1. Anarchy frustrates cooperation because states are preoccupied with
   security (Waltz)
   1. Logic of security dilemma (Jervis 1976)
   2. The system incentivizes autarky (Mearshimer)
2. Anarchy /predicts/ cooperation because self-help suggests
   outsourcing what cannot be accomplished internally (Keohane, etc.)
   1. Anarchy as culture and /the meaning/ between two states (Wendt 1992)
3. Anarchy is called into question because cooperation suggests
   hierarchy and order and not Hobbesian system.
   1. Milner and the appearance of order (????)
   2. Cooperation is a bargaining game (Schelling 1960) and it may be
      within a state's interest to cooperate. 
*** Cooperation and state behavior
1. Harmony and Discord require no change in behavior on the part of actors.
2. Cooperation is /contingent/ change in behavior interdependent on
   the actions of other partners in the deal.
** Audience Costs
*** Theory (Fearon 1994)
*** Criticisms
**** Limited Scope
1. The relative strength of the "changed circumstances" appeal calls
   into question the scope of conditions when audience cost theory holds
2. i.e., if a leader can escape punishment by same "oh, it was prudent
   to raise stakes when I said it, but imprudent to carry out the
   threat" then we might being to wonder if audience costs has any
   meaning.
**** Empirical challenges: 
Snyder and Borghard 2011 find four points of concern: 

1. Leaders prefer flexibility in crisis and are therefore more likely
   to prefer ambiguity.
2. Domestic public will care more about the substance of the final
   policy more than whatever perceived consistency
3. The public concern with the national honor is largely independent
   of whatever threats were made.
4. Authoritarian regimes interpret the dynamics of audience costs
   differently than democracies, thereby weakening the strength of
   audience costs in practice

* International Political Economy
** OEP
*** Method and approach
*** Key findings
*** Criticisms
**** Oatley 2011. 
Methodological reductionism produces inaccurate knowledge. Most OEP
seems to drop the final step (model the system with necessary) by
assuming rather than showing that the system does not have an effect. 
* International Organization

* Foreign Policy
** History vs Social Science
1. Three major differences between IR and Diplomatic History (Dip-hist)
   1. Chronology (history) vs Causal mechanisms (IR)
   2. Individual events (history) vs Comparative cases (IR)
   3. Morality: history more comfortable, IR emphasizes facts over values
2. IR can, and should, draw from history as it builds theories and
   hypotheses without falling into an inductive-qualitative trap.
** Small group dynamics
1. How do groups perceive another actors behavior (Jervis 1978)
