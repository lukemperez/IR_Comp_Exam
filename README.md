# IR Comp Exam

This repo is a collection of Emacs `.org` and `.md` files consisting of an outline and literature summaries for the International Relations Prelim exam in the Government Department at UT Austin. The exam will be held sometime at the end of August 2016. At present this repo is maintained individually by myself (Luke M Perez), although other classmates are free to contribute. 

Please note that if you are not an IR student at UT Austin, you are free to clone, fork, or download this repository but not contribute. Every program is different. The manner, scope, and depth of preparation must be suited to each student for his or her program.
