# 1984. *After Hegemony* 

Rationalism and anarchy could produce cooperation because ... 

(Note the echoing from Schelling's essay on Bargaining: there
Schelling discussed his illustrative games, highlighting the different
bargaining positions states may find themselves in. The final example
showed a world where both states naturally want to renegotiate toward
a maximum yield for both parties.)

# 1988. *International Institutions: two approaches* (ISQ)

Survey of two emerging approaches to the study of international
institutions, rationalist and constructivist. Rationalist approaches
rely on game theory and neoclassical economic theory to develop models
of utility maximizing strategies. Rationalist approaches assume actors
are self-aware they are in institutions---often even self-conscious
that they constructed the institutions that constrain
themselves. Institutions, in this view, rely on /exchange theory/
positing that (a) there are gains to be made from cooperation but (b)
cooperation is costly: thus, institutions help manage those
costs. Constructivist approaches, conversely, point out that actors
are often unaware they are acting under the constraints of the
institution and that institutions contain and promote /norms/ as the
primary constraint mechanism on actors.
