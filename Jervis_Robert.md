# 2009. *International Politics and Diplomatic History: Fruitful
Differences*

Political science and diplomatic history differ in at least three
ways: (1) historians privilege chronology while political scientists
prioritize causal knowledge; (2) Political scientists rely on
comparative analysis---via large-n, or case studies---while historians
explain individual events; (3) historians are more confident, on
balance, to make moral judgments regarding the behavior and actions of
others. These differences are often unbridgeable insofar as the
questions and methods of the two are unique to each field even as they
both study the same subject area: international relations. But we
should embrace these differences and seek to understand what each
brings to bear on social inquiry because there is much to be gained
from doing so.
